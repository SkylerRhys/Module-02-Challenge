# Skyler Jones Portfolio
A landing site to showcase Skyler's work and an assignment for coding bootcamp.

## Challenges
It took me a long time to fully optimize the webpage for cell phones. I kept running into issues with spacing.

## Sources
I used the reset.css file supplied by the EdX bootcamp. 

## Features
The nav links in the header navigate to various parts of the page. <br /> 

The images all respond on hover. Generally, hovering increases their opacity to 1. <br />

The first application always appears bigger than the other four. <br />
